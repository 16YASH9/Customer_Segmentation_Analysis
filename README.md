Customer Segmentation Analysis â€“ Project Summary
Objective:-
The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score using K-Means Clustering. By grouping customers into distinct clusters, businesses can identify different customer profiles and create targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset:-
The dataset contains customer details, including:

Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-

Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed.
Visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps were used to understand the data distribution.
Correlation analysis was conducted to check relationships between features.

K-Means Clustering Implementation:-

The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
The K-Means algorithm was applied to segment customers into different groups.
Clusters were visualized using a scatter plot, with distinct colors representing each group.
The centroids of the clusters were marked to show the center of each group.

Insights & Business Impact:-

Customers were grouped based on their spending patterns and income levels.
Different customer categories such as high spenders, low-income cautious buyers, and budget-conscious customers were identified.
Businesses can use these insights to personalize marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and optimize product offerings.

Conclusion:-

This project successfully applies unsupervised machine learning to categorize customers into meaningful segments. The insights gained can help businesses enhance customer experience, increase sales, and build data-driven marketing strategies.
